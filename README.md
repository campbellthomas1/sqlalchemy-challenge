# sqlalchemy-challenge

## In this challenge I was asked to use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. I used the provided files (climate_starter.ipynb and hawaii.sqlite) to complete your climate analysis and data exploration. I also provided a precipitation analysis that displays different percipitation values across one year and it will be plotted using a bar graph, as well as a station analysis talking about different stations in hawaii and which station had the greatest number of observers. I also found the lowest, highest, and average temperatures for the most active station.

## I designed a climate app after I was done with my climate analysis and data exploration. I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I developed, including a homepage, precipitation, stations, tobs, and start and end dates.

## I did run into a few issues with getting the start and end dates to work but I will continue to work on that.
